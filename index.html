    <h1>Bunnies</h1>
    <p style="color: green;">The <em></em> is awesome because  they are affectionate, intelligent, and have big personalities, offering unique companionship without needing daily walks. They are clean, can be litter trained, and their quiet nature makes them suitable for apartment living. Bunnies are also entertaining, showcasing their happiness through "binkies" (happy leaps and twists) and providing natural companionship as they bond with their owners and enjoy playing with toys.   <strong></strong>.</p>
